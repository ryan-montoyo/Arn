# arnys-party-discord-bot
## This discord bot works locally. It takes a youtube URL link after a '!play ' command and plays that video. I also implemented a !pause, !resume and !stop command to the bot. Unfortunately, at this time I have not deployed it to be running 24/7 which means only I can activate when it is live and when it's not via my local machine. 
I will one day deploy this bot to be live 24/7 and will update this message when it happens. I also plan to keep working on this bot to add more functions such as add to queue.

Until then, feel free to use my code to create your own local music bot, just be sure to implement your own bot token in a .env file so that the code runs on your bot, as you don't have access to my private bot token.
